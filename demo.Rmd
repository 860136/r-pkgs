## Demos

A demo is very much like a function example, but is longer, and shows how to use multiple functions together. Demos are `.R` files that live in the `demo/` package directory, and are accessed with the `demo()` function. Each demo must be listed in `demo/00Index` in the form: `demo-name  Demo description`. The demo name is the name of the file without extension, e.g. `demo/my-demo.R` becomes `my-demo`.

Why use vignettes instead of demos?

* Demos are not automatically run by `R CMD check`. This means that the code 
in them is not tested, and you won't find out if they break.

* Vignettes have output inline so you can see the results without running
it yourself.

* Vignettes are listed on CRAN. More people know about vignettes than demos.
