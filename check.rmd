# Automated checking {#check}

R provides a number of automated checks for the quality of your code. These are known as `R CMD check`. If you're planning on submitting to CRAN, it is essential that you run `R CMD check`, but it's also useful to run even if you're not.

`R CMD check` emits three types of message:

* `ERROR`: These are definite problems and you should fix regardless of whether
  or not you're submitting to CRAN.
  
* `WARNING`: These are likely problems. You must fix if you're planning to 
  submit to CRAN, and it's a good idea to look into them even if you're not.
  
* `NOTE`: These are sometimes false positives, so if you're not planning on 
  submitting to CRAN, you might not need to fix. If you are submitting to
  CRAN you should work around them. It is possible to argue you way around
  them, but that requires human intervention. It's almost always better to 
  fix them so they don't appear. 

`R CMD check` is frustrating the first time you run it - you'll probably discover many problems that you need to fix. The key to making `R CMD check` less frustrating is to run it more often. The sooner you find out about a problem after making it, the easier it is to fix. The limit of this approach is to run `R CMD check` every time you make a change, and in fact you'll learn how to do that with travis, an automated continuous integration tool.

## Workflow

To check your package, run `devtools::check()`, or in RStudio, press Cmd + Shift + E.

I recommend using these tools instead of running `R CMD check` from the console because `devtools::check()`:

* Documents the package first.

* Checks a built package. This is the recommend check process to avoid 
  spurious local temporary artefacts (like compilation artefacts).

* Sets a consistent locale.

* Ensures that you're using the same version of R that you're currently running.

* Provides arguments to make `R CMD check` run as closely as possible to 
  CRAN.

* Sets the `NOT_CRAN` environment variable which allows you to selectively
  skip tests on CRAN.

## Checks

I don't recommend reading the list of checks exhaustively. Instead, if one of the checks fails, come back here for a simple explanation of what the problem is, and how you might go about fixing it. Common problems described in individual chapters. Provide comprehensive listing here with backlinks to individual chapters.

The checks change with each version of R, so you may want to consult the most recent version of this chapter online: <http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/check.html>

### Check metadata

The first few lines describe the checking environment. I'm running R 3.1.1 on OS X with UTF-8 charset.

* __Using log directory__ ‘/Users/hadley/Documents/web/httr.Rcheck’
* __Using R version__ 3.1.1 (2014-07-10)
* __Using platform__: x86_64-apple-darwin13.1.0 (64-bit)
* __Using session charset__: UTF-8

Next the description is parsed and the package version is printed. Here I'm checking the version 0.5.0.9000 (you'll learn more about that weird version number in XXXX) of the httr package.

* __Checking for file__ ‘httr/DESCRIPTION’
* __This is package__ ‘httr’ __version__ ‘0.5.0.9000’

### Package structure

* __Checking package namespace information__.

* __Checking package dependencies__.

* __Checking if this is a source package__.

* __Checking if there is a namespace__.

* __Checking for executable files__.

* __Checking for hidden files and directories__.

* __Checking for portable file names__.

* __Checking for sufficient/correct file permissions__.

* __Checking whether package ‘httr’ can be installed__.

* __Checking installed package size__. Data is not adequately compressed. See 
  [data](#data-cran) for more details.

* __Checking package directory__.

* __Checking ‘build’ directory__.

* __Checking DESCRIPTION meta-information__.

* __Checking top-level files__.

* __Checking for left-over files__.

* __Checking index information__.

* __Checking package subdirectories__.

### R code

* __Checking R files for non-ASCII characters__.

* __Checking R files for syntax errors__.

* __Checking dependencies in R code__.

* __Checking S3 generic/method consistency__. S3 methods must have compatible 
  method signatures to their generic. This means that the method must have the 
  same arguments as its generic, with one exception. If the generic  includes 
  `...` you can have additional arguments. A common cause of this error is 
  defining print methods, because the `print()` generic contains`...`.
  
    ```{r}
    print
    
    # BAD
    print.my_class <- function(x) cat("Hi")
    
    # GOOD
    print.my_class <- function(x, ...) cat("Hi")
    ```

* __Checking replacement functions__.

* __Checking R code for possible problems__.

    You must use `TRUE` and `FALSE` in your code and examples, not `T` and `F`.

### Package loading and unloading

* __Checking whether the package can be loaded__.

* __Checking whether the package can be loaded with stated dependencies__.

* __Checking whether the package can be unloaded cleanly__.

* __Checking whether the namespace can be loaded with stated dependencies__.

* __Checking whether the namespace can be unloaded cleanly__.

* __Checking loading without being on the library search path__.

### Documentation

You can run the most common of these outside `R CMD check` with `devtools::check_doc()` (which automatically calls `devtools::document()` for you). If you have documentation problems, it's best to iterate quickly with `check_doc()`. 

* __Checking Rd files__. All exported objects must be documented. All paramters 
  of functions must be documented.

* __Checking Rd metadata__.

* __Checking Rd line widths__.  Lines in RD files must be less than 90 
  characters wide. This is unlikely to occur if you wrap your roxygen 
  comments to 80 characters wide. For very long urls, use a link-shortening
  service like [bit.ly](http://bit.ly).

* __Checking Rd cross-references__. These typically represent typos.
  Also recall the syntax for linking to functions in other packages: 
  `\link[package]{function}`. Sometimes I accidentally flip `\code{}` and
  `\link{}`: `\link{\code{function}}` will not work.

* __Checking for missing documentation entries__.

* __Checking for code/documentation mismatches__. This make sure that 
  documentation matches the code. This should never fail because you're using
  roxygen2 which automatically keeps them in sync.

* __Checking Rd `\usage` sections__.

* __Checking Rd contents__.

* __Checking for unstated dependencies in examples__.

* __Checking examples__. Every documentation example must run without errors,
  and must not take too long. Exclude failing or slow tests with `\donttest{}`.
  See [documenting functions](#man-functions) for more details.
  
    A common cause of problems is relying on internal functions - examples can 
    only use exported functions.
    
    Examples are one of the last checks run, so first them can be painful if
    you have to run `devtools::check()` each time. Instead, use 
    `devtools::run_examples()`: it only checks the examples, and has an optional 
    parameter which tells it which function to start at - that way once you've 
    discovered an error, you can rerun from just that file, not all the 
    files that lead up to.

## Compiled code

* __Checking foreign function calls__.

* __Checking line endings in C/C++/Fortran sources/headers__.

* __Checking line endings in Makefiles__.

* __Checking for portable use of `$(BLAS_LIBS)` and `$(LAPACK_LIBS)`__.

* __Checking compiled code__.

### Tests

* __Checking for unstated dependencies in tests__. Every package used by tests 
  must be included in the dependency fields. If the package is only used in the 
  tests (and not elsewhere in the package), list it in the `Suggests` field.

* __Checking tests__.  Each file in `tests/` is run. If you've followed the 
  instructions in [testing](#tests) you'll have at least one file: 
  `testthat.R`. Failing here is an ERROR.

### Vignettes

* __Checking installed files from ‘inst/doc’__.

* __Checking files in ‘vignettes’__.

* __Checking for unstated dependencies in vignettes__. As with tests, every
  package that you use in a vignette must be listed in the `DESCRIPTION`. 
  If a package is used only for a vignette, and not elsewhere, make sure 
  it's listed in `Suggests`.

* __Checking package vignettes in ‘inst/doc’__. This checks that every source
  vignette (i.e. `.Rmd`) has a built equivalent (i.e. `.html`) in `inst/doc`. 
  This shouldn't fail if you've used the standard process outlined in 
  [vignettes](#vignettes). If there is a problem, start by checking your
  `.Rbuildignore`.

* __Checking running R code from vignettes__. The R code from each vignette 
  is run. If you want to deliberately execute errors (to show the user what 
  failure looks like), make sure the chunk has `error = TRUE, purl = FALSE`.

* __Checking re-building of vignette outputs__. Each vignette is re-knit to
  make sure that the output corresponds to the input. Again, this shouldn't
  fail in normal circumstances.
  
* __Checking PDF version of manual__. Occassionally you'll get an error when 
  building the PDF manual. This is usually because the pdf is built by latex and 
  you've forgotten to escape something. Debugging this is painful - your best 
  bet is to look up the latex logs and combined tex file and work back from 
  their to `.Rd` files then back to a roxygen comment. I consider any such
  failure to be a bug in roxygen2, so please let me know.

To run vignettes, the package first must be installed. That means R:

* Installs the package without vignettes.
* Builds all the vignettes.
* Re-installs the package with vignettes.

If you have a lot of compiled code, this can be rather slow. You may want to use `--no-build-vignettes`

## Checking after every commit with Travis

If you use [git and github](#git), I recommend exploring the very useful [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). Travis is a continuous integration service which means it will run code of your choosing every time you push a commit to github. 

1.  Run `use_travis()` to set up a basic `.travis.yml` config file. The 
    defaults are usually adequate for simple packages.

1.  Navigate to your [account](https://travis-ci.org/profile) and enable
    travis for the repo you want to test on.

1.  Commit and push to github.

1.  Wait a few minutes to see the results in your email.

Now you're set up so that `R CMD check` will be run every time you push a commit to github, and every time some one does a pull request.  Any time a failure occurs you'll find out about it right away. I find this really useful - it also encourages me to run `R CMD check` more frequently locally, because I know if it fails I'll find out about a few minutes later, often once I've moved on to a new challenge.

Common configuration:

* Fail not only on errors, but also on warnings
* Install binary packages
* Install github packages

Since you can use Travis to run arbitrary code you can use it to implement arbitrary push-to-deploy strategies. For example, it's relatively easy to deploy code to S3 - this makes it easy (for example) to update a documentation website.
