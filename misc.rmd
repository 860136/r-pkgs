# Other components

There are a handful of other directories that are valid, but rarely used:

* `exec/`: executable scripts. Files in `exec/` are marked as executable, and 
  are suitable for inclusion of executable scripts.

* `tools/`: auxilary files needed during configuration, or for source needed
  to recreate scripts.

* `po/`: you can include translations for error messages. This is useful
  but beyond the scope of this book. See the 
  [Internationalization][internationalization] chapter of "R extensions" 
  for more details.
