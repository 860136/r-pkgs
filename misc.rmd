# Other components {#misc}

There are three other directories that are valid top-level directories. They are rarely used:

* `exec/`: for executable scripts. Compared to other directories, files in 
  `exec/` are automatically flagged as executable.

* `po/`: translations for error messages. This is useful but beyond the scope 
  of this book. See the [Internationalization][internationalization] chapter of 
  "R extensions" for more details.

* `tools/`: auxiliary files needed during configuration, or for sources that need
  to generate scripts.
