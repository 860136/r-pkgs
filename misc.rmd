# Other components

* `inst/`

* `exec/`: executable scripts
* `po/`: translation files

* the `inst/CITATION` file describes how to cite your package. If you have
  published a peer reviewed article which you'd like people to cite when they
  use your software, this is the place to put it.

* the `demo/` directory contains larger scale demos, that use many 
  features of the package.
