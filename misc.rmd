# Other components

This chapter describes a handful of other directories that are useful to know about but don't merit a chapter in their own right. There are two relatively important directories:

* `exec/`: executable scripts. 
  "Subdirectory exec could contain additional executable scripts the package needs, typically scripts for interpreters such as the shell, Perl, or Tcl. NB: only files (and not directories) under exec are installed (and those with names starting with a dot are ignored), and they are all marked as executable (mode 755, moderated by ‘umask’) on POSIX platforms. Note too that this is not suitable for executable programs since some platforms (including Windows) support multiple architectures using the same installed package directory."

* `po/`: translation files. <http://cran.rstudio.com/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html#Internationalization>

* `tools/`: "Subdirectory tools is the preferred place for auxiliary files needed during configuration, and also for sources need to re-create scripts (e.g. M4 files for autoconf)."
