# Package level documentation

Vignettes exists to help the user understand how to use the package as a whole. Function level documentation is useful once you know exactly what you want to do, and you've discovered the appropriate function: once you've done all that, function-level documentation helps you use the function appropriately. Vignettes get you to point where you can do that: they explain what the package does as a whole, breaks the functions down into useful categories, and shows you how to combine the functions (and maybe functions from other packages) to solve problems.

Vignettes are long-form pdf guides to your package. There are many types of vignettes, but here I'll only discuss the most useful: Rmarkdown.

If you write a nice vignette, you might want to consider submitting it to the Journal of Statistical Software or the R Journal. Both are electronic only journals and peer-reviewing can be very helpful for improving the quality of your vignette and the related software.
