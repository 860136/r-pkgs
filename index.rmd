# Welcome

This is the in-progress book site for __"R packages"__. The book for R users who want to learn how to build packages, the fundamental unit of code re-use in R.

Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data. In this section you'll learn how to turn your code into packages that others can easily download and use.

Writing a package can seem overwhelming at first. So start with the basics and improve it over time. It doesn't matter if your first version isn't perfect as long as the next version is better.

It will eventually be published as a real book with O'Reilly.  The final version of the book is due in Feburary 2015, so it should be available in mid 2015. Thanks to the publisher, the wiki will continue to be freely available after the book is published.
