# R code

The `R/` directory contains all your R code, so copy in any existing code.  Files containing R code should always have the extension `.R` (you can also use `.r`, but I recommend sticking to `.R` for consistency).

It's up to you how you arrange your functions into files. There are two
possible extremes: all functions in one file, and each function in its own
file. I think these are both too extreme, and I suggest grouping related
functions into a single file. My rule of thumb is that if I can't remember
which file a function lives in, I probably need to split them up into more
files: having only one function in a file is perfectly reasonable,
particularly if the functions are large or have a lot of documentation. As
you'll see in the next chapter, often the code for the function is small
compared to its documentation (it's much easier to do something than it is to
explain to someone else how to do it.)

## Starting a package

There are two ways to get started with a new package:

* Firstly, you can just create an R directory and move in your R code.

* Alternatively, use `devtools::create("pkgname")`: this will create a
  directory called `pkgname`, containing an empty `R/` directory and 
  some useful files that you'll learn about in the course of this book.

__Never__ use `package.skeleton()`: it's designed for a bygone era of package development, and mostly serves to make your life harder, not easier.

## Rstudio projects

If you use RStudio, I highly recommend using an RStudio project for your package:

* Projects isolate state so that unrelated things stay unrelated.

* You get handy code navigation tools like `F2` to jump to a function
  definition and `Ctrl + .` to look up functions by name.

* You get useful keyboard shortcuts for common package development tasks.
  See Help | Keyboard shortcuts, or press Alt + Shift + K to see them all.

* Projects are a light weight text file, and devtools makes sure that 
  it's not included in binary packages that you share with others 
  (by including in `.Rbuildignore`).

`create()` will automatically create a `.Rproj` file for you. To create one after the fact, run `devtools::use_rstudio()` in the package directory.

## Loading code

The first advantage of using a package is that it's now easier to reload all of your code. There are two options: 

* `load_all()`, Cmd + Shift + L, reloads all code in the package. It's 
  fast but takes some shortcuts that occassionally backfire. In Rstudio,
  this also saves all open files, saving you a key press.

* Build & reload, Cmd + Shift + B. This is only available in Rstudio, because
  it installs the package, then restarts R, then loads the package with 
  `library()` (If you don't use Rstudio, you'll have to do this by hand;
  that's a bit painful.)

These commands make it very easy to iterate between writing code in your editor and trying it out in the R console.

## Development cycles

The package development cycle describes the sequence of operations that you use when developing a package. You probably already have a sequence of operations that you're comfortable with when developing a single file of R code. It might be:

1. Try something out on the command line.

1. Modify it until it works and then copy and paste the command into an R file.

1. Every now and then restart R and reload the complete file to make sure
   you've ordered all the code correctly.

Or maybe you:

1. Write all your functions in an R file and save it.

1. `source()` the file into your current session.

1. Interactively try out the functions and see if they return the correct
  results.

1. Repeat the above steps until the functions work the way you expect.

With devtools and Rstudio, you can:

1. Edit R files in the editor.

1. Press Cmd + Shift + L

1. Explore the code in the console

1. Rinse and repeat.

You might also be a little bit more worried about checking that your functions work, not only now, on your computer, but also in the future and on other computers. You'll learn more about more sophisticated workflows that prevent that from happening in [testing](#tests).
